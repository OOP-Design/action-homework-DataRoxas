## Exercise \#1
What is the difference between a ```KeyListener``` and a ```KeyAdapter```?

  A KeyListener is an interface that can be implemented by a programmer writting a keyboard event, while the abstract class KeyAdapter can be extended for a similar purpose. The benefit of a KeyListener is not requiring the user to write up the methods, merelly to implement them. The KeyAdapter allows the programmer to choose which methods they want and to customize them as needed for their purposes.

## Exercise \#2
What is the difference between a ```MouseListener``` and a ```MouseMotionListener```.

  A MouseListener trakcs actions on the mouse such as clicking, scrolling, etc. The MouseMotionListener on the other hand, as its name implies, tracks the actual motion of the mouse as the user moves it, or in some cases, the movement of the user's finger on a trackpad.

## Exercise \#3
Given a ```MouseEvent```, Java has the ```getButton``` and ```getModifiersEx``` methods for determining which mouse buttons are pressed. Are both methods really needed, that is, do they differ in any way?
